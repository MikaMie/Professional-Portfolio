# Project Name

## Short Summary:

In this project, I focused on deepening my CSS and frontend skills. The goal was to create a clean, performant design with special attention to responsiveness across all device sizes.

## Technologies:

The entire design was built using the Tailwind CSS framework. I made extensive use of utility classes to keep the styling consistent, scalable, and maintainable.

## Responsiveness:

The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. With Tailwindâ€™s Grid system, Flexbox, and responsive breakpoints, the content dynamically adjusts from 1 to 3 columns. Images scale smoothly using object-cover and w-full. The page is divided into structured sections, each aligned through a consistent Flex layout.

## Highlights:

Smooth hover effects on the project tiles include zoom animations and overlay transitions, enhancing the user experience. All images are optimized for fast load times.
