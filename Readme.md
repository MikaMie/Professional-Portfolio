# 📁 Responsive Portfolio Page

A clean, fully responsive portfolio website built with **Tailwind CSS** and a focus on scalable, maintainable design.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project helped me deepen my frontend and CSS skills. I focused on building a performant and elegant layout that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- 🧱 Flexbox & CSS Grid

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The layout adjusts dynamically based on device size. Using Tailwind's Grid, Flexbox, and responsive breakpoints, content is structured in 1–3 columns depending on screen width.

Images scale smoothly using `object-cover` and `w-full`. The entire page is sectioned into clean layout blocks using a unified flex-based design.
